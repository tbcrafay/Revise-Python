2. Arithmetic Operations:
○ Calculate the sum, dierence, product, and quotient of two numbers (e.g., 15
and 4). Print the results with descriptive labels.
○ Calculate the remainder when 27 is divided by 5.
○ Calculate 3 raised to the power of 4

x = 15
y = 4

add = x + y
difference = x - y
product = x*y
quotient = x**y

my_dict = {"add": add, "difference": difference, "product": product, "quotitent": quotitent}
print(my_dict)

remainder = 27//5
